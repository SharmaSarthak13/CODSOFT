Project Title: Movie Genre Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

Description:
This project focuses on classifying movie genres based on plot summaries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The workflow includes:

Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords

Feature extraction: using TF-IDF vectorization

Modeling: trained a Naive Bayes classifier

Evaluation: predicted genres for test plots and checked model accuracy

This end-to-end pipeline showcases how machine learning can automate tasks like content classification â€” a valuable skill in domains like entertainment, recommendation systems, and content moderation.
